# Deploy the kong api gateway 
## What is Kong API gateway?
According to its official documentation, Kong Gateway is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway, built for hybrid and multi-cloud, optimized for microservices and distributed architectures. 
Kong Gateway runs in front of any RESTful API and can be extended through modules and plugins. Itâ€™s designed to run on decentralized architectures, including hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud deployments.

With Kong Gateway, users can:

Leverage workflow automation and modern GitOps practices
Decentralize applications/services and transition to microservices
Create a thriving API developer ecosystem
Proactively identify API-related anomalies and threats
Secure and govern APIs/services, and improve API visibility across the entire organization.


## Technologies used
* Docker
* Nginx
* Docker-compose
* HTTPie

Please ensure that these tools above are installed.


For the purpose of this assessment, I used the Kong Gateway (OSS) mode which is an open-source package containing the basic API gateway functionality and open-source plugins.


## Steps 
1. Create an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instance using AWS.
2. Install Docker using this command: `sudo apt install docker.io`.
3. Install Docker-compose.
4. Add your user to the sudoers group using this command: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
5. Exit and ssh back into the instance, then run the command: newgrp docker to activate the changes.
6. Setup swap limit capabilities on docker by editing the /etc/default/grub file
7. Add the following string inside of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT variable:cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1
8. Save the file and reboot your instance.
9. Run sudo update-grub command.
10. Clone the repo and check the docker-compose.yml file.
11. Add docker-compose to the sudoers group.
10. Create the docker-compose file. This file contains the PostgreSQL, Kong and konga images configuration. 
10. Run the docker-compose file using `docker-compose up -d`.
11. verify the the containers are running and you access the kong admin-api through this url:http://18.133.234.14:8001

 
 # Deploy konga dashboard (using docker) for kong API administration 
 ## What is Konga-dashboard?
 According to the author, Konga is a fully featured open source, multi-user GUI, that makes the hard task of managing multiple Kong installations a breeze. It can be integrated with some of the most popular databases out of the box and provides the visual tools you need to better understand and maintain your architecture.

 ## Steps
 1. The konga dashboard is already running as a docker container and can be accessed  using this url: http://18.133.234.14:1337.
 2. Configure the kong admin api to be accessed through the konga GUI.
 3. First, create a user and include your credentials.
 4. Create a connection to the kong-admin api. Add name as kong-admin-api and http://18.133.234.14:8001 as the Kong Admin API url.


 # Configure nginx to listen to requests from specific ports externally and route to kong and konga. 
 ## Steps
 1. Ensure that nginx is installed and its service enabled.
 2. Cd into /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and create an nginx.conf file using `sudo touch nginx.conf`.
 3. Edit the nginx.conf file.
 4. Make sure to reload the nginx service after configuration of the nginx.conf file.
    `sudo systemctl reload nginx.service`
 5. Test to ensure that the nginx is configured and ports are routing to the specific endpoints.
 6. Access the kong api through this url: http://18.133.234.14/kong 
 7. Access the konga-dashboard through this url: http://18.133.234.14/konga 

Problems: the http://18.133.234.14/konga points to a page with the following "Neat! Your account is activated."
